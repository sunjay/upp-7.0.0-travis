// In uniprocessor, the program cannot work without some preemptions of the low-priority tasks, which is why this yield
// is there. The obvious problem is that when the sleep expires, both high-priority tasks may run because they set their
// timeout at almost exactly the same time. After the two high-priority tasks run, only one of the low-priority tasks
// runs until the next timeout. As a result, each low-priority task alternates on each timeout.  So instead of executing
// N times, which is needed to terminate, the low-priority tasks execute N/2 times, and the last one running just
// spins. We tried to fix this problem by having the low-priority task yield when its companion high-priority flag
// changes so both low-priority tasks execute each time a timeout occurs. However, this hack does not work because the
// timeouts can get out of sync, and hence, two SIGUSR1s are sent. As a result, a signal can arrive just after the yield
// to a low-priority task, which cause a schedule back to the other low-priority task before the first one can update
// that it has seen its companion high-priority flag's change. Basically, the yield has to occur far enough away from
// the SIGUSR1 window that a yield is guaranteed to switch to the other low-priority task.
//
// In multiprocessor, the previous problem does not occur because the other low-priority task is spinning on the other
// processor, and hence, both low-priority tasks see their companion high-priority flag change.
